# rastar
visualisation of the A* (a-star) path-finding algorithm in a rasterized environment

Press a mouse button to place the start point (orange), then the end point (purple), then as many (white) walls as you want. You can remove those by clicking on them again.
Then, if the start and end points are placed, you can start the algorithm with SPACE to show the process step-by-step or with ENTER to let the algorithm find the path instantly.

This is just a small project to see how the A* algorithm works and how to implement it best.
